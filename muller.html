        <h1>UK Back Pages: Chelsea Want to Sign Thomas Muller and Sell Diego Costa</h1>

        <p class="lead">Tick tock, tick tock—the opening of the transfer window draws ever closer. 

According to Tuesday's Daily Mirror, Chelsea are keen to bring in Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller. 

The German international has long been linked with Manchester United, but the struggling champions are reportedly now keen to bring him in while shipping out Diego Costa. 

What Bayern Munich make of all this is another story. 

Meanwhile, the Daily Star claims Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has become "disillusioned" with life at Old Trafford and wants "showdown" talks with manager Louis van Gaal..

		<br> Manchester United's hopes of adding a world-class attacker to their ranks in 2016 have suffered a substantial setback following developments in their pursuit of Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller and Harry Kane.

Muller has been linked with a reunion with former Bayern boss Louis van Gaal, but Lothar Matthaus—another figure with ties to the Bundesliga club—has urged the forward to remain in Bavaria for a long, long time, via Uche Amako of the Daily Express:

It is not necessary for him to go to Manchester United. Just as Chelsea is not necessary. 

Barcelona perhaps, that may be attractive. But I do not know if their style of play would suit his own. 

My opinion is that he should remain at Bayern for at least a lifetime!

At no other club can he play with the joy and pleasure as he reflects today. He needs no new challenge since Bayern already plays each year at the top.

Remaining at the Allianz Arena may be the best possible option for Muller. The club have given him the launching pad to become one of the world's elite, and he's now competing for major honours on an annual basis.

However, United are understood to be seeking a "marquee signing," according to Amako's report, and the 2014 World Cup winner certainly falls in line with that description.</p>
